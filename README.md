# Why this project.
This project was used to allow me to view any and all messages that had been sent via my portfolio website htttp://www.chrishaig.me . It was also necessary due to the limitations to email functions by the webhost that is currently hosting my portfolio website.

## Why i created the project this way
The project was created this way as i had created numerous web panels before and i wanted to try something different. This solution also allowed me to receive notifications any time that i was on my computer with the notification to alert me to any messages that have been sent. This can be seen in the image below:

## How it works
When the application is first opened with no messages the application will simply stay blank until a message has been receive.

However, if there is already messages present in the system the application will simply display them with all names and emails down the left handside with the right hand side space saved for the content of the message.

Once, i have i selected a message to view all i have to do is click on the appropriate name and email and it will display the relevant content for the specified message.

## Overall
**The project is long from finished and has some current issues that have to be taken care of such as:** 

    • Removing any html from messages that have been submitted
    • Making each id of messages unique to prevent id clashing
    • Allow Replying from inside the application
    • Allowing attachments
